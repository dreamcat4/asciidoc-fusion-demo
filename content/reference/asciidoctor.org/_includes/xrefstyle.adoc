- user-manual: Customizing the Cross Reference
////

In the native converters (HTML, PDF, and EPUB3), you can customize the style of the automatic cross reference text using the `xrefstyle` document attribute.
The xrefstyle attribute is designed to port the behavior of the DocBook toolchain to the native Asciidoctor converters.

By default, the cross reference uses the reftext of the target, which falls back to the title if reftext is not specified.
For example, if you're linking to a section titled “Installation”, the text of the cross reference link is shown as:

....
Installation
....

If the reftext attribute is specified on the referenced element, that value is always used as is.
Attribute references are substituted in the reftext value during parsing and reftext substitutions (specialchars, quotes, and replacements) are substituted in the value when it is used during conversion.

If the reftext is not specified, the cross reference text is automatically generated.
There are three built-in styles you can choose from to customize the generated text of a cross reference, as specified by the xrefstyle attribute.

full:: the reference label followed by the reference number and emphasized title (e.g., Section 2.2, “Architecture” or Figure 1, “Big Cats”).
short:: the reference label followed by the reference number (e.g., Section 2.2 or Figure 1).
basic:: the title only (Architecture or Big Cats).

This formatting only applies to references that have both a number and a title and do not have explicit reftext.

Let's assume you want reference a section titled “Installation” that has the number 3.2.2.
The full style is displayed as follows:

....
Section 3.2.2, “Installation”
....

The short style is displayed as follows:

....
Section 3.2.2
....

The basic style is displayed as follows:

....
Installation
....

If the reference is a chapter or an appendix, the title is displayed in italics instead of quotes (even when the xrefstyle is basic).

You can customize the label of the reference using one of the caption attributes.
For example, to customize the word “Section”, you'd define the `section-caption` attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:section-caption: Sect
----

NOTE: In the future, the suffix of these attributes will likely change from `-caption` to `-label`.

If you unset the attribute, the label is dropped from the cross reference text.
For example, if you unset the `section-caption` attribute in the document header:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:!section-caption:
----

Then the full xrefstyle will display as:

....
3.2.2, “Installation”
....

Currently, only these built-in styles are supported.
In the future, there are plans to allow a custom formatting string.
