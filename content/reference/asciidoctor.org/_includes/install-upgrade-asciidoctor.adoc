== System Requirements

//tag::systemreq[]
Asciidoctor works on Linux, OS X (aka Mac OS X) and Windows.

Asciidoctor requires one of the following implementations of Ruby:

* Ruby 1.8.7
* Ruby 1.9.3
* Ruby 2 (2.0.0 or better)
* JRuby 1.7 (Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 modes)
* JRuby 9000
* Rubinius 2.0 (Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 modes)
* Opal (Javascript)

We expect Asciidoctor to work with other versions of Ruby as well.
We welcome your help testing those versions if you are interested in seeing them supported.
