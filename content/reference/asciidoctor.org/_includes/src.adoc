- user-manual: Syntax Highlighting Source Code
////

Developers are accustomed to seeing source code that uses color and other styling to emphasize the code's structure (i.e., keywords, types, delimiters, etc.).
This technique is known as [.term]_syntax highlighting_ source code (or [.term]_source highlighting_, for short).
Since this technique is so prevelant--one could say expected, Asciidoctor integrates a wealth of libraries to syntax highlight source code blocks in your document.
This list includes CodeRay, Pygments, highlight.js, and prettify.

=== Enabling Source Highlighting

When enabled, syntax highlighting gets applied to listing or literal blocks that have the `source` block style and a source language.
However, syntax highlighting is _not_ enabled by default.

To enable syntax highlighting in a document, you must set the `source-highlighter` document attribute.
You can set this attribute in the document or from the CLI or API.

//Some source highlighters, such as CodeRay and Pygments, require an additional library to be installed.
//Others, like highlight.js and prettify, load the library at runtime from a CDN or from a custom URL or file path.

If you set the attribute in the document, it _must_ be defined in the <<user-manual#doc-header,document header>>.

----
= Document Title
:source-highlighter: <value>
----

For example, here's how to enable syntax highlighting using CodeRay:

----
= Document Title
:source-highlighter: coderay
----

=== Available Source Highlighters

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use CodeRay, Pygments, or Rouge, you must have the appropriate library installed on your system.
See the <<coderay>> or <<pygments>> section to find installation instructions.
(We don't yet have a section about Rouge).

On the other hand, if you're using a client-side syntax highlighting library like highlight.js or prettify, there's no need to install additional libraries.
The generated HTML will load the required source files from a CDN (or custom URL or file path).

=== Applying Source Highlighting

To apply highlighting to source code, you must add the `source` block style to a listing block, literal block, or paragrah and also specify a source language.

[listing]
.Code block with title and syntax highlighting
....
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-base-co]
....
<1> An optional ID can be added to the block. See <<anchordef>>.
<2> Assign the block name `source` to the first position in the attribute list.
<3> Assign a source language to the second position.
<4> An optional title can be added to the block.
<5> The source block name is typically assigned to listing and literal blocks.

.Result: Source block with title and syntax highlighting
====
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-base-co-res]
====

.Source paragraph
----
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-para-co]
----
<1> Place the attribute list directly on the paragraph
<2> Once an empty line is encountered the syntax highlighting is unset.

.Result: Source paragraph
====
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-para]
====

If the majority of your source blocks use the same source language, you can set the `source-language` attribute in the document header and assign a language to it.

[listing]
.Source language attribute
....
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-lang]
....

Additionally, you can use an <<user-manual#include-directive,include directive>> to insert source code into an AsciiDoc document directly from a file.

[listing]
.Code block inserted from another file
....
include::ex-src.adoc[tags=src-inc]
....

//TODO mention the use of AsciiDoc tags to include code snippets and the indent flag to reset indentation

TIP: If you specify custom substitutions on the source block using the `subs` attribute, make sure to include the `specialcharacters` substitution if you want to preserve syntax highlighting.
However, if you do plan to modify the substitutions, we recommend using <<incremental-substitutions,incremental substitutions>> instead.

.Highlighting PHP source code
****
The PHP language has two modes.
It can either be used as a standalone language (pure mode) or it can be mixed with HTML (mixed mode) by putting it inside PHP tags (a form that resembless an XML processing instruction).
This presents some challenges for the syntax highlighter.

If the code in the source block is pure PHP, you should use the language tag `php`.
For example:

[listing]
....
[source,php]
----
echo "Hello, World!";
----
....

If the PHP source is mixed with HTML, you should either use the language tag `html+php`, as shown here:

[listing]
....
[source,html+php]
----
<p>
<?php echo "Hello, World!"; ?>
</p>
----
....

or you should use the language tag `php` and set the `mixed` option on the source block, as shown here:


[listing]
....
[source%mixed,php]
----
<p>
<?php echo "Hello, World!"; ?>
</p>
----
....

Under the covers, the syntax highlighter is configured to assume an implicit start PHP tag is present when the language tag is `php`.
Both the `mixed` option and the language tag `html+php` disable this setting.
