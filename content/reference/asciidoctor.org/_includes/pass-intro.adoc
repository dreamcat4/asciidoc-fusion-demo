The passthrough is the primary mechanism by which to escape content in AsciiDoc (far more comprehensive than using the backslash).
As the name implies, a passthrough passes content directly through to the output document.
In some forms, it's possible to apply a custom set of substitutions before the content is reintroduced.
Otherwise, the content is excluded from all <<user-manual#subs,substitutions>>.

WARNING: Using passthroughs to pass content (without substitutions) can couple your content to a specific output format, such as HTML.
In these cases, you should use conditional preprocessor directives to route passthrough content for different output formats based on the current backend.
