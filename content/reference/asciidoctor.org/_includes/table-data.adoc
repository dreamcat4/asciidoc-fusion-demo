=== Escaping the Cell Separator

The parser scans for the cell separator to divide the cells _before_ it processes the cell text (no matter what that text contains, even passthroughs).
If your content includes the cell separator, you must escape that character using a leading backslash.
Otherwise, it will be interpreted as a cell separator.
The backslash will be removed from the converted output.

Consider the following example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[cols=2*]
|====
|The default separator in PSV tables is the \| character.
|The \| character is often referred to as a "`pipe`".
|====
----

This table will render as follows:

.Result: Converted PSV table that contains pipe characters
[cols=2*]
|====
|The default separator in PSV tables is the \| character.
|The \| character is often referred to as a "`pipe`".
|====

Notice that the pipe character appears unescaped in the rendered result.

Escaping the cell separator character can be tedious.
There are also times when you can't or don't want to modify the content in the table cell.
To handle those cases, AsciiDoc allows you to override the cell separator.
The cell separator is controlled using the separator attribute on the table block.
You'll want to select a character that will never be used for content.
A good candidate is the broken bar, or `¦`.

Here's the previous example rewritten using a custom separator.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[cols=2*,separator=¦]
|====
¦The default separator in PSV tables is the | character.
¦The | character is often referred to as a "`pipe`".
|====
----

Notice that it's no longer necessary to escape the pipe character in the content of the table cells.

=== CSV and DSV Data Formats

Tables can be created from data stored as Comma Separated Values (CSV) and Delimiter Separated Values (DSV).
To use one of these dataset types, set the value of the `format` attribute on the table to `csv` or `dsv`, respectively.
The main difference between tables with one of these formats and `psv` tables is how the data inside the table delimiters is arranged.

When the format attribute is set to `csv`, the data separator is a comma (`,`), as seen in the table below.

[source]
----
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=csv]
----

.Result: Rendered CSV table
[width="90"]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=csv]

When the format attribute is set to `dsv`, the data separator is a colon (`:`).

[source]
----
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=dsv]
----

.Result: Rendered DSV table
[width="90"]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=dsv]

Asciidoctor also provides shorthand notation for setting CSV and DSV table formats.
The first position of the table block delimiter (i.e., `|===`) can be replaced by the data delimiter to set the table format (e.g., `,===`).

To set the format of the table to CSV using shorthand notation, simply replace the leading pipe (`|`) in the table delimiter with a command (`,`), as shown here:

[source]
----
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-csv]
----

.Result: Rendered CSV table using shorthand syntax
[width="90"]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-csv]

In the same way, the DSV format can be specified by replacing the leading pipe (`|`) with a colon (`:`).

[source]
----
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-dsv]
----

.Result: Rendered DSV table using shorthand syntax
[width="90"]
include::ex-table-data.adoc[tags=s-dsv]

DSV and CSV datasets don't support formatting of individual cells.
However, you can apply formatting, such as the AsciiDoc style, to a column of cells using a table-wide column spec:

[source]
----
[cols="1h,1a"]
,===
Sky,image::sky.jpg[]
Forest,image::forest.jpg[]
,===
----

Keep in mind that endlines are not preserved in CSV and DSV data.
That does somewhat limit the type of content you can put in these cells, particularly when using the AsciiDoc cell style.

DSV and CSV datasets can be, and often are, inserted into a table using the <<user-manual#include-directive,include directive>>.

[source]
----
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
\include::tracks.csv[]
|===
----

.Result: Rendered table of CSV data pulled from a separate file
[width="90"]
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
include::tracks.csv[]
|===
