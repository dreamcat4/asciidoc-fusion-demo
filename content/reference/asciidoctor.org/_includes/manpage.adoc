One of the more specialized uses of AsciiDoc is to serve as a shorthand for generating man pages (short for manual pages) for Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

A man page is coded in the roff typesetting language.
By adhering to a specific structure in the man page file, the `man` command can parse the content and present a formatted document in a textual (command line) pager.
Manual pages provide a unified help catalog for all commands in the system.
For a full description, see the http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/roff.7.html[roff man page] (or type `man roff` or `man 7 man`).

{adr} can produce roff-formatted man pages if the structure of the AsciiDoc document adheres to the manpage doctype structure (described later in this section).

To produce a roff-formatted man page from an AsciiDoc file that declares the manpage doctype, run:

 $ asciidoctor -b manpage source.adoc

Note that the manpage converter sets the output file name to `progname.1`, where `progname` is the name of the command and `1` is the volume number, as defined in the source document.

{adr} can also produce HTML and PDF versions similar to the `man` output for viewing in other contexts.
To see the man page in HTML instead, run:

 $ asciidoctor source.adoc

Here is an example man page composed in AsciiDoc for the `eve` command:

[source,asciidoc]
----
include::ex-manpage.adoc[]
----

The manpage doctype has the following required parts:

Document Header::
A manpage document header is mandatory.
The title line contains the man page name followed immediately by the manual section number in round brackets.
The title name should not contain white space.
The manual section number is a single digit optionally followed by a single character.

The NAME Section::
The first manpage section is mandatory, must be titled "`NAME`" and must contain a single paragraph (usually a single line) consisting of a list of one or more comma separated command name(s)
separated from the command purpose by a dash character.
The dash must have at least one white space character on either side.

The SYNOPSIS Section::
The second manpage section is mandatory and must be titled "`SYNOPSIS`".

Subsequent sections are optional, but typical sections include "`SEE ALSO`", "`BUGS REPORTS`", "`AUTHORS`" and "`COPYRIGHT`".

There are several built-in document attributes that affect only manpages.
If used, they must be set in the document header.

Refer to {man-raw}[the AsciiDoc source of the Asciidoctor man page] to see a complete example.
The man page for Asciidoctor is produced using the built-in manpage converter in Asciidoctor.
The man pages for git are also produced from AsciiDoc documents, so you can use those as another example to follow.
