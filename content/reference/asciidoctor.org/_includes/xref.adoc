In Asciidoctor, the xref inline macro is used to create cross references (also called in-text or page citations) to sections, blocks or phrases that have an ID (regardless of whether that ID is explicit or auto-generated).

An implicit cross reference is created by enclosing the ID of the target block or section (or the path of another document with an optional anchor) in double angled brackets.

====
include::ex-xref.adoc[tags=base]
====

You can also link to a block or section using the title by referencing its title.
However, the title must begin with an uppercase letter (in basic Latin) without any leading formatting marks.

Converters usually use the reftext of the target as the default text of the link.
When the document is parsed, attribute references in the reftext are substituted immediately.
When the reftext is displayed, additional reftext substitutions are applied to the text (specialchars, quotes, and replacements).

You can override the reftext of the target by specifying alternative text at the location of the cross reference.
After the ID, add a comma and then enter the custom text you want the cross reference to display.

You can also use the inline xref macro as an alternative to the double angled bracket form.
