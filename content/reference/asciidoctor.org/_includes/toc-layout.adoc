=== Side Column Placement
// tag::column[]
When converting to HTML, the TOC can be positioned in a column to the left or right of the main content by assigning the `left` or `right` value to the `toc` attribute.
This positioning is achieved using CSS (so it depends on support from the stylesheet).
The column is scrollable and fixed.

=== In-Document Placement
// tag::place[]
`toc` values of `auto` (the default), `preamble`, and `macro` place the TOC in the main document area.

When the value of `toc` attribute is unspecified or `auto`, the TOC is inserted directly below the document header (document title, author and revision lines).

When `toc` is set to `preamble`, the TOC is placed immediately below the preamble.

CAUTION: When using the preamble placement, the TOC will not appear if your document does not have a <<Preamble,preamble>>.
To fix this problem, just set the `toc` attribute to an empty value (or `auto`).

To place the TOC anywhere else in the document, set the `toc` attribute to `macro`.
Then, put the `toc::[]` block macro at the location in the document where you want the TOC to appear.
The `toc::[]` macro should appear at most once in any document.

If `toc` is not set to `macro`, any `toc::[]` macros will silently be ignored.

<1> The toc attribute must be set to macro in order to enable the use of the `toc::[]` macro.
<2> In this example, the `toc::[]` macro is placed below the first section's title, indicating that this is the location where the TOC will be displayed once the document is rendered.
